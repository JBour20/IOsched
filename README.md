# iosched

To run, type 'make' to produce the executable 'iosched'. My program requires an input file and algorithm specification. Additional tracing information is supported with the '-l' flag. Run as follows:

./iosched -s\<algo\> [-l] inputfile

s/l options can be provided in any order. Valid algorithm specifications include FIFO (i), SSTF (j), SCAN (s), CSCAN (c), and FSCAN (f).
